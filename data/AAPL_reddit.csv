Here is what i sent:

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Government’s plans to force Apple and other companies to weaken security on cloud storage services like iCloud. This is a serious threat to the privacy and security of millions of people, including your constituents.

The biggest issue with these proposals is that once a backdoor exists, it isn’t just the UK Government that can use it—anyone can. Cybercriminals, hackers, and hostile countries like Russia and China would be able to exploit these weaknesses, putting personal data, businesses, and even national security at risk. There is no such thing as a “safe” backdoor. History has shown that any intentional security vulnerability will eventually be found and abused by bad actors.

Apple has already responded to this by disabling its most secure cloud storage features in the UK, and they plan to remove them for existing users soon. This shows just how serious the risk is. If companies are forced to weaken encryption, many will either pull services from the UK or leave users exposed to attacks.

All this will achieve is pushing people like me to switch to services based outside the UK Government’s jurisdiction. If the Government forces UK-based services to introduce security weaknesses, people will simply move their data elsewhere to maintain their privacy and security. This will not make anyone safer—it will just encourage people to use alternatives that the Government has no oversight of.

Most people store huge amounts of personal data in the cloud—private photos, documents, passwords, financial information, and even medical records. Weakening encryption means none of this will be truly secure anymore. No one should have to choose between using essential technology and keeping their private data safe.

I urge you to oppose these dangerous proposals and stand up for the privacy and security of ordinary people. I would appreciate hearing your position on this issue and what steps you will take to ensure our data remains protected.",48.0

Why don’t they take the lead and let us have back doors into their systems first?

Here’s some practical advice: settings -> iCloud -> turn on advanced data protection.

Write the key down, keep it in a safe place.

By default, your data is encrypted on Apple’s iCloud servers, but they hold the keys in case you need to recover the data. 

Advanced data protection means you generate the key, and Apple can’t see it. That said, you assume the risk of losing all of your data if you ever lose that key. There’s nothing the UK or any government can do short of breaking into your house/torturing you to get the encryption key, and if everyone uses it they’ll eventually give up this nonsense.",45.0,When will these people learn that any back door can and will eventually be used against them… Salt Typhoon is a great example…,41.0

2025-01-02,Apple to pay $95 million to settle Siri privacy lawsuit,2807,"The podcast ""Reply All"" looked at a situation where a man went to pick up his mother from the airport for a visit. In the car she mentioned her perfume had been confiscated by TSA and that she needed to find a place to get more. That night on his computer, that man started getting perfume ads. He investigated it and did a story for ""Reply All""

What he uncovered had happened is his mom, while sitting and waiting for her plane, had googled places to buy her specific brand of perfume in San Francisco. Geo location on her phone knew she had traveled to San Francisco, and social media had the link that her son lived there. These ""services"" combined to connect the dots that she was traveling to visit her son and wanted perfume. That night her son got ads for perfume.

In this case the phone hadn't listened to them, it was just invasion of privacy with all the cookies we accept blindly.

I don't discount that Siri listens even when you don't invoke it. I'm suggesting more that a lot of the things we *think* are these devices listening to us are actually just all the interwoven things we use day in and day out, connecting the dots that are innocuous by themselves but create a very full picture of who we are when combined.

Another example story they gave was about a man who started getting ads on facebook regarding coming out as a gay man. He had never told anyone he was gay, and was shocked to see these ads showing up on his timeline. As he was a reporter he actually delved into it and found that Facebook has something like 70,000 buckets it sorts people into with very high accuracy. So based on your behaviour, friend list, publicly available (vs privately limited) information, groups you like, videos you like, etc it can develop a strikingly accurate picture of who you are. You can download your facebook data and see some of this, not all the buckets but a number of them. When I did this every single bucket it had me in was accurate. They can do a lot with the probabilities of who you are based on the data you give them freely.",860.0,">Two plaintiffs said their mentions of Air Jordan sneakers and Olive Garden restaurants triggered ads for those products.

2024-06-24,Apple found in breach of EU competition rules | European Commission finds iPhone maker broke new laws designed to protect smaller competitors against big tech platforms,428,"Article:

>Apple has been found to be in breach of sweeping new EU laws designed to allow smaller companies to compete and allow consumers to find cheaper and alternative apps in the tech business’s app store.

>The European Commission, which also acts as the EU antitrust and technology regulator, said it had sent its preliminary findings to Apple after an investigation launched in March.

>“For too long Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies — denying consumers new opportunities and choices,” said Thierry Breton, the European commissioner responsible for digital markets, on X.

>In preliminary findings, against which Apple can appeal, the European Commission said it believed its rules of engagement did not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) “as they prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternatives channels for offers and content”.

>The company has 12 months to comply before it face fines of up to 10% of its global revenues but the EU hopes ongoing dialogue will lead to compliance rather than sanctions.

>In addition, the commission has opened a new non-compliance procedure against Apple over concerns its new contract terms for third-party app developers also fall short of the DMA’s requirements.

>It is the third non-compliance investigation opened by the commission into Apple since the DMA came into force last year and the sixth launched in total, with two other inquiries outstanding into Google and one into Meta, the owner of Facebook.

>At the heart of Monday’s findings are three elements of Apple’s practices, including fees charged to app developers for every purchase made within seven days of linking out to the commercial app.

>The commission says a fee for such matchmaking is justifiable but what Apple charges goes “beyond what is strictly necessary”.

>In its preliminary findings on its earlier investigation, the EU has reiterated that the new digital laws require Apple to ensure that developers should be able “free of charge to inform their customers of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases”.

>As part of the new investigation, the commission is examining 0.50c charge, or “core technology fee”, Apple demands every time a developer’s app is installed on a phone.

2024-06-24,Apple found in breach of EU competition rules | European Commission finds iPhone maker broke new laws designed to protect smaller competitors against big tech platforms,421,"Article:

>Apple has been found to be in breach of sweeping new EU laws designed to allow smaller companies to compete and allow consumers to find cheaper and alternative apps in the tech business’s app store.

>The European Commission, which also acts as the EU antitrust and technology regulator, said it had sent its preliminary findings to Apple after an investigation launched in March.

>“For too long Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies — denying consumers new opportunities and choices,” said Thierry Breton, the European commissioner responsible for digital markets, on X.

>In preliminary findings, against which Apple can appeal, the European Commission said it believed its rules of engagement did not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) “as they prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternatives channels for offers and content”.

>The company has 12 months to comply before it face fines of up to 10% of its global revenues but the EU hopes ongoing dialogue will lead to compliance rather than sanctions.

>In addition, the commission has opened a new non-compliance procedure against Apple over concerns its new contract terms for third-party app developers also fall short of the DMA’s requirements.

>It is the third non-compliance investigation opened by the commission into Apple since the DMA came into force last year and the sixth launched in total, with two other inquiries outstanding into Google and one into Meta, the owner of Facebook.

>At the heart of Monday’s findings are three elements of Apple’s practices, including fees charged to app developers for every purchase made within seven days of linking out to the commercial app.

>The commission says a fee for such matchmaking is justifiable but what Apple charges goes “beyond what is strictly necessary”.

>In its preliminary findings on its earlier investigation, the EU has reiterated that the new digital laws require Apple to ensure that developers should be able “free of charge to inform their customers of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases”.

>As part of the new investigation, the commission is examining 0.50c charge, or “core technology fee”, Apple demands every time a developer’s app is installed on a phone.

>The allegations that Apple is breaking EU law are the first against a tech company under the DMA, landmark legislation introduced last August to ensure six designated “very large online platforms” including Google, Amazon, Meta and ByteDance (TikTok) compete fairly.

Apple updated the security notice on its website Wednesday, which states that threat notifications are “designed to inform and assist users who may have been individually targeted by mercenary spyware attacks.”

According to several Indian news outlets, including the Economic Times and the Indian Express, some iPhone users in the country received notifications from Apple alerting them of an attack “that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID.”The notification informed the user they were likely being targeted specifically “because of who you are or what you do,” and urged them to take it “seriously.”

The reports do not name any individuals in India who received the notifications, but it comes just a week before the start of the country’s six-week general elections—the world’s largest democratic exercise.

Apple doesn’t include specific steps for users who have received the notifications, other than urging them to enlist help from cybersecurity experts.

Big Number150. That’s the number of countries in which iPhone users have received threat notifications since 2021, the company said.In October, Apple sent out similar notifications to several prominent political leaders in India who represented opposition parties. Rahul Gandhi, the top leader of Congress—India’s main opposition party—told reporters he and several members of his and other opposition parties had received notifications that their iPhones were being targeted by “state-sponsored attackers.” At the time, Gandhi called out Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government and accused them of carrying out the attack. Prominent activists and journalists who are critical of the Modi government also received the notification at the time. Apple confirmed it had sent out the notifications but said it had not attributed it to a “specific state-sponsored attacker.” In late December, Amnesty International said it had conducted a forensic investigation to confirm Apple’s findings and said NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware was used to carry out the attacks. Indian authorities publicly denied carrying out the attacks but, according to the Washington Post, they reportedly pressured Apple to “come up with alternative explanations for the warnings to users,” to ease the political fallout.",17.0,Hey you know what's great?

>The management of the church, a concrete-and-copper construction that opened in 2016, say that they decided to cooperate with filmmakers for the first time to help fund the modernisation of the building’s energy system.

>

>The temple is being used between 4 and 13 April by cast and crew filming the third season of *Foundation*, an American science fiction show loosely based on Isaac Asimov’s eponymous series of stories.

>During the period of filming, worshippers wishing to attend mass at the temple can do so in one of its chapels and must inform security staff when they enter the premises. The church authorities have apologised for any inconvenience.

>This week, some locals noticed a large flag with an unusual symbol hanging outside the building amid filming.

>

>“For the first time we decided to cooperate with filmmakers,” said Marek Drabik, a spokesman for the board of the Divine Providence Centre that manages the site, quoted by Catholic press agency KAI. “There are two important reasons behind this.”

>“First, the film’s vision corresponds with the depiction of the temple as a place of refuge for people, building community,” he explained.

>“Second, thanks to this production it will be possible to finance an important element of the modernisation of our energy infrastructure,” continued Drabik.

>“The construction of an energy turbine will significantly reduce the costs of electricity, which is a huge component of the fixed operating costs of the complex.”

>The spokesman added that they are “convinced that this film will show the true beauty of the architecture of the temple”.

Apple officially released the device on Feb. 2 in the United States. M.Video did not say how it managed to obtain the devices in Russia.

""M.Video-Eldorado continues to introduce Russians to the latest innovations in the world of gadgets,"" the company said in a statement on Wednesday. ""Store visitors will be able to personally test the new product and learn about its capabilities.""

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Retailing at $3,500 in the U.S. market, Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset allows users to browse the web, chat and even watch movies at a high resolution.

M.Video, which is offering the version with 256 GB memory for 579,999 roubles ($6,276), said it had opened product testing spaces in stores in six Russian cities, including its two flagship stores in Moscow.

Another reseller, re:Store, was offering the same version for 579,990 roubles, according to its website. It had also opened test-drive spaces in Moscow and was planning more in other Russian cities.

Apple paused all its product sales in Russia in March 2022 in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine while Western-imposed sanctions sought to curb technology exports to Russia.

A Russian tech blogger told CNBC that his team had pre-ordered the devices in New York and flew with them to Moscow.

A Chinese state-backed institution has devised a way to identify users who send messages via Apple Inc.’s popular AirDrop feature, Beijing’s government claims, as part of broader efforts to root out undesirable content.

The Beijing institute developed the technique to crack an iPhone’s encrypted device log to identify the numbers and emails of senders who share AirDrop content, the city’s judicial bureau said in an online post. Police have identified multiple suspects via that method, the agency said, without disclosing if anyone was arrested.

Rices tend accumulate a decent amount of inorganic arsenic, depending on the chemical speciation of the soil.  Nearly every food crop will have a tendency to do this with one nasty compound or element another.

By contrast, other metals are actually depleted in the fruit of an apple tree, so their accumulation ratios are below 1.0

Since this is known about apples, it’s incumbent on farmers to monitor soil and rain Pb levels.  Even if they don’t, industrial processing can introduce lead as well, so there should be a final check before it leaves the factory.

To make things worse, it’s very hard to measure metal concentrations, so it’s not like it’s possible for most consumers to do it anyway.

The Global Times also said China's natural resources department made on-site investigations into land use by key Foxconn businesses in the provinces of Henan and Hubei.

""Legal compliance everywhere we operate around the world is a fundamental principle of Hon Hai Technology Group (Foxconn),"" the company said in a statement.

""We will actively cooperate with the relevant units on the related work and operations,"" it added.

Foxconn's founder Terry Gou is running as an independent candidate in Taiwan's presidential election that is due to take place in January.

The election is expected to have a significant influence on Taiwan's relationship with China given tensions between them have ratcheted up in the past year.

As Beijing's claims over the self-governed island have grown more assertive, presidential candidates have pitched their differing visions on how to respond.

Mr Gou has positioned himself, based on his years of experience working in China, as an alternative to the incumbent Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is seen as hostile to Beijing.

However, phones with higher SAR values may not a
actively emit stronger RF than phones with a low SAR during normal use.  
It just means that they can, and if needed, will.

If you put two phones next to one another, a phone with a lower SAR could actually emit at more power than phones with a higher SAR, if their antennas and electronics are worse.

But when the phone with the lower SAR no longer gets a signal, the phone with the higher SAR will still get a signal, but it will be emitting at a higher power.

Note: SAR values are tested in the worst possible condition. (for example being in a building with thick concrete walls and a bad reception). 

However, phones with higher SAR values may not a
actively emit stronger RF than phones with a low SAR during normal use.  
It just means that they can, and if needed, will.

If you put two phones next to one another, a phone with a lower SAR could actually emit at more power than phones with a higher SAR, if their antennas and electronics are worse.

But when the phone with the lower SAR no longer gets a signal, the phone with the higher SAR will still get a signal, but it will be emitting at a higher power. And this is the problem with the iPhone 12, it's that in the worst case scenario (where the phone needs to emit at full power because it cannot get a good signal), it emits with too much power.",425.0

The Department of Justice announced Tuesday that Weibao Wang, who worked at Apple from 2016 to 2018 on the company's Annotation Team, is being charged with six counts of theft of Apple's “entire autonomy source code,” tracking systems, behavior planning for autonomous systems, and descriptions of the hardware used, according to CNBC. 

Wang reportedly had ""broad access"" to databases that the DOJ said could only be accessed by 2,700 of Apple's 135,000 employees. 



The indictment details that four months before quitting Apple, Wang had accepted a new job at a U.S. based subsidiary of a Chinese company that was developing autonomous driving technology. Wang started to port over ""large amounts"" of Apple's technology and source code, it says.

At the time, only 5% of Apple employees even knew about the project and even fewer (2%) had access to one or more of the databases that Wang used to ascertain the information he allegedly stole. 

The report says that when authorities searched Wang's home in 2018, they found ""large quantities of stolen, confidential, and proprietary data"". After the search warrant was executed, Wang fled the country, boarding a flight to Guangzhou, China from San Francisco International Airport, CNBC reported.

2022-12-08,Privacy changes set Apple at odds with UK government over online safety bill | Apple,24,"> It could put Apple in opposition to the government. The forthcoming online safety bill requires companies to act to limit the spread of child sexual abuse material and content promoting terrorism in messaging apps, and gives Ofcom the power to issue technical notices forcing changes to products if they do not comply.

> “We support strong encryption but it cannot come at the expense of protecting the public. End-to-end encryption cannot be allowed to hamper efforts to catch perpetrators of the most serious crimes,” a government spokesperson said.

Ah yes, the classic ""we are protecting the kids"" theme. And as usual it does absolutely fuck all to prevent any real criminals while trying to undermine basic rights. 

Ultimately this whole argument is so pointless since regardless of what protections platform provides or does not provide - it's basic math that allows people to share absolutely any content they want without any option to intercept it. 

It pretty much works like this:

* Step 1 - you want to send someone a box with something but you don't trust the messenger so you put a lock on it. 
* Step 2 - messenger can't open a box with a lock so they send it over to the recipient
* Step 3 - recipient obviously cannot open the box. Instead they actually place their OWN lock on it and send it back to sender. 
* Step 4 - sender removes his lock and sends it back to the recipient. 
* Step 5 - messenger still can't open that box
* Step 6 - recipient gets the box and removes his lock 

Now just replace ""lock"" with a ""multiply by a prime number"" and box with ""stream of ones and zeroes"". Welcome to encryption 101. Completely bypasses all the government mandates and backdoors. 

Or heck, just hide one message inside another [image/message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography). 

Honestly it's tiring to hear this ""gonna protect the kids"" argument over and over. I know it's a lie, everyone with any tech knowledge knows it's a lie but it certainly doesn't stop governments from attempting to seize any privacy from normal citizens. None of what they are doing is actually preventing ACTUAL bad guys - because it simply can't. It can however mean massive data leaks and backdoors for law abiding citizens, spying on them en masse, you name it.",6.0,,,,

However, according to a worker, after arriving at the plant, the new recruits were told by Foxconn that they would only receive the first bonus on March 15, and the second installment in May – meaning they must work through the Lunar New Year holiday, which starts in January 2023, to get the first of the bonus payments.

“The new recruits had to work more days to get the bonus they were promised, so they felt cheated,” the worker told CNN.”

2022-11-10,Apple supplier Foxconn to update on outlook after China COVID curbs,19,"TAIPEI, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier and iPhone assembler Foxconn (2317.TW) plans to update its fourth-quarter outlook on Thursday, having warned this week of the impact of COVID-19 restrictions at a major plant in China's Zhengzhou.  
  
Foxconn's main Zhengzhou plant in central China, which employs about 200,000 people, has been rocked by discontent over stringent measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, with many workers fleeing the site.  
  
The lockdown ended on Wednesday, though Foxconn said it was maintaining ""closed loop"" operations, referring to a bubble-like arrangement commonly imposed as part of virus prevention measures in China, where employees sleep, live and work isolated from the wider world.

Foxconn said on Monday it was working to resume full production there as soon as possible, and, having previously guided for ""cautious optimism"" in the fourth quarter, said it would ""revise down"" its outlook given events in Zhengzhou, though provided no details. 

Foxconn will release its third-quarter earnings on Thursday at 0700 GMT, with analysts expecting on average a profit of T$41.3 billion, according to Refinitiv, an 11.7% year-on-year increase, benefiting from sustained demand for high-end consumer electronics and data centres.  
  
The company said it will also provide an update on its view for the current quarter; though it does not provide a numerical outlook, only a broad forecast in terms of the general direction.  
  
A source familiar with the matter said Foxconn aims to resume full production at its Zhengzhou plant by the second half of November.  
  
Apple said on Monday it expects lower shipments of high-end iPhone 14 models than previously anticipated following a significant production cut at the virus-blighted plant in China, dampening its sales outlook for the year-end holiday season.

The fourth quarter is traditionally the hot season for Taiwan's tech companies as they race to supply cellphones, tablets and other electronics for the year-end holiday period in Western markets.  
  
Shares in Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, closed up 2.5% on Wednesday, outperforming the broader market's (.TWII) 2.2% rise.  
  
The shares have fallen 1.4% so far this year.",2.0,,,,

2022-10-18,Workers strike at Apple's core in unprecedented industrial action.,21821,Someone really wanted to make that pun,4315.0," Apple doesn’t get enough bad press for their treatment of workers. And while they try to act like the “ethical” mega-corporation, they are as shitty as google, Amazon, etc.  They just hide it more effectively. 

I was a corporate employee for 6 years. A good one. I had to go on leave because I was having some weird symptoms, and ended up with a terminal diagnosis. Luckily I had long term disability insurance to pay my salary, so Apple was only paying me $46/month for internet as I worked from home. However, they contested that it is an “undue hardship” and terminated me. This took my medical and life insurance away (yay America). I worked with a labor attorney about it and refused to speak to anyone from Apple without him present/on the call.  When they were presented with the line “Apple fires terminally ill wife of US Navy combat veteran,” they started working to keep it quiet. It’s legal (maybe) but undeniably shitty. They presented me with a contract that they would pay for 18 months of COBRA coverage if I agreed to confidentiality, non-disclosure, non-retaliation, and non-disparagement clauses. Basically holding my literal life hostage so I would agree to not discuss their actions in public. Straight up extortion but legal. 

They try to present themselves as clean and caring. They are not. Did they stop including chargers to lower waste?  No, they did it for the almighty dollar. Do they care about worker’s conditions?  Only if it’s bad publicity. They don’t give *any* fucks about people that are normally exploited (ie factory workers in “brown people countries”). 

I think my experience sums up their corporate policy pretty well. I am dying and therefore no longer productive so they fired me and took all my insurance. They don’t give a fuck that I’m sick; the only fucks they give are about that dollar and hiding their shitty behavior behind a clean veneer. 

Fuck them.",3772.0,"Apple employs about 154,000 people worldwide. Most of those retail workers last *quarter* according to their financial report

If they took half of what they gave to shareholders for *one quarter*, not even a full year, each employee would get a $90,909 raise, which is about double what the average Apple retail employee gets paid in the US.

2022-08-05,Apple warns suppliers to follow China rules on 'Taiwan' labeling,80,Apple is no stranger to enabling small-dick energy.,65.0,Lmao Apple is such a BITCH to China.,43.0,"Article text: 

Apple has asked suppliers to ensure that shipments from Taiwan to China strictly comply with Chinese customs regulations after a recent visit by senior U.S. lawmaker Nancy Pelosi to Taipei stoked fears of rising trade barriers.

Apple told suppliers on Friday that China has started strictly enforcing a long-standing rule that Taiwanese-made parts and components must be labeled as being made either in ""Taiwan, China"" or ""Chinese Taipei,"" sources familiar with the matter told Nikkei Asia, language that indicates the island is part of China.

The U.S. tech titan urged suppliers to treat the matter with urgency to avoid possible disruptions caused by goods and components being held for scrutiny, the people said.

The timing is sensitive for Apple, as its suppliers are preparing components that will go into its next iPhones and other new products set to launch this autumn.

Using the phrase ""Made in Taiwan"" on any import declaration forms, documents or cartons could cause shipments to be held and checked by Chinese customs, the sources added. Penalties for violating such a rule is a fine of up to 4,000 yuan ($592) or, in the worst-case scenario, the shipment being rejected, one of the sources said.

This presents a dilemma for suppliers who need to ship materials, components or parts from Taiwan to China, however, as the democratically governed island also requests that all exports be labeled with product of origin, which means they must carry the words ""Taiwan"" or ""Republic of China,"" the island's official name, according to suppliers and logistics companies.

Apple's warning comes after shipments from Taiwan to one of iPhone assembler Pegatron's facilities in China were held for review on Thursday to see if the import declaration form or cartons are labeled with ""Taiwan"" or ""Republic of China.""

Beijing has long viewed Taiwan as a part of its territory and is strongly opposed to senior U.S. officials such as House Speaker Pelosi making formal diplomatic visits to the island.

To avoid any shipping chaos and further supply chain disruptions, Apple has also told suppliers to form contingency plans or quickly review and amend their labels on cartons and forms for shipments from Taiwan to China, if necessary, the people added.

The increased scrutiny of shipments to Pegatron's Suzhou facility came a day after a senior Pegatron executive and other Taiwanese chip industry leaders met with Pelosi in Taipei at a lunch hosted by President Tsai Ing-wen.

Interoperability requires standards, and standards come into being very slowly as the writers try their damndest to foresee how it can be used and abused. It took about 5 years for BIMI to take hold (just released on iOS), and that’s just showing a company logo in an email. The scope of change here is breathtaking for Apple.

How, for example, does one create an interoperable encryption layer without exposing the private keys ? IMessage uses [HSM’s](https://www.futurex.com/products/hardware-security-modules/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIloqMuvPh-AIVKmpvBB1WLA9hEAAYAyAAEgL34fD_BwE) which doesn’t port well to a software-only world. It also uses very ephemeral keys, which makes interoperable syncing a nightmare, and this is focusing only on one small part of the demands.

I fear the bar may have been set too high. If there’s no chance to reach it, then closing down all Apple stores, making iDevices available for mail-order only, and creating a ‘worldwide’ App Store might be far more attractive. I suspect the cachet value for having an iPhone in Europe would only go up in that instance.

> Brussels - Negotiators from the European Parliament and EU member states agreed Thursday on a landmark law to curb the market dominance of US big tech giants such as Google, Meta, Amazon and Apple.

> The law contains about 20 rules that in many cases target practices by Big Tech that have gone against the bloc&#039;s rules on competition, but which Brussels has struggled to enforce.

> The Big Tech companies have lobbied hard against the new rules and the firms have been defended in Washington, where it is alleged that the new law unfairly targets US companies.

The world's second largest economy is still doggedly pursuing its zero-Covid strategy, even as other nations reopen and try to live with the virus. The lockdowns in major Chinese cities will impact not just the country's post-pandemic recovery, but could deliver a new blow to global supply chains.
The southern city of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, is home to Chinese tech giants like Tencent (TCEHY) and Huawei. It imposed a week-long lockdown starting Monday, after recording 66 positive cases Saturday.
In its statement provided to CNN Business on Monday, Foxconn said that the ""date of factory resumption is to be advised by the local government.""
Foxconn has two major campuses in Shenzhen. The Taiwanese company has ""adjusted"" its production line to other sites to ""minimize the potential impact"" from the disruption, it added. It didn't elaborate on which locations would take on extra work.

Shares in Taipei-based Foxconn Interconnect Technology, a subsidiary of Foxconn, plunged 9.8% in Hong Kong on Monday.

China is grappling with its worst Covid outbreak since the original outbreak in Wuhan in early 2020 as cases surge across the country. On Sunday, it reported 2,125 local Covid-19 cases across 58 cities, according to the National Health Commission (NHC).
In Shenzhen, all businesses — apart from those deemed essential or engaged in supplying Hong Kong — have suspended operation or have implemented work-from-home policies.
Public transportation, including subways and buses, have been suspended in the city, which has a population of 17.5 million.
Shenzhen is also home to one of the world's largest container ports, and any disruption there could hit an already stressed out global supply chain. Last summer, the Yantian port in Shenzhen was forced to shut down for nearly a week after infections were found among dock workers, causing a massive backlog of goods that took months to clear and a spike in global freight rates. So far the port continues to operate.
Shares of major companies based in Shenzhen fared poorly in Hong Kong on Monday. Tencent sank 9.8%. Telecoms firm ZTE (ZTCOF) lost 7%. BYD (BYDDF), China's largest electric car manufacturer, fell 8.3%. And AAC Technologies (AACAF), an audio components maker, plunged 9%.
Apart from Shenzhen, local authorities have also locked down the northeastern industrial hub of Changchun since Friday, where nine million residents were forbidden from leaving their neighborhoods.

China's Xi'an lockdown hits some of the world's largest chipmakers
Shanghai, the country's largest business center, has imposed stringent measures after a spike in Covid cases, closing schools and cinemas and restricting travel into the city.
These lockdowns come just months after China shut the northwestern city of Xi'an, which hit major business operations, including those of Samsung and Micron, two of the world's biggest chipmakers.
These stringent measures taken to control the pandemic have hit China's economy hard in recent times. Earlier this month, the government set an economic growth target at around 5.5% for 2022, the lowest official goal in decades.

Their biggest favor to dictatorships is the total prohibition on sideloading or installing apps from outside the App Store which allows Apple to restrict what software you may use and prevent access to any that offends the Russian or other governments, such as the apps they banned in 2021 and 2019 that allowed people to coordinate political protests in Russia and Hong Kong.

2022-01-26,Pegasus hack reported on iPhones of Human Rights Watch official,72,[removed],7.0,"Today at 12:01 a.m. EST

Human Rights Watch official Lama Fakih was at a meeting in Beirut, where she lives and works, when a strange message appeared on her iPhone on Nov. 24: “ALERT,” it said. “State-sponsored attackers may be targeting your iPhone.”

When Fakih, a dual U.S.-Lebanese citizen, considered what “state-sponsored attackers” might be interested in hacking her phone, the list was so long it was hard to know who was responsible.

But the means soon became clear: Somebody had used Pegasus, the powerful Israeli-built spyware, to peer into two of Fakih’s iPhones and into her life, Human Rights Watch announced Wednesday following forensic investigations.

“I’ve sort of been caught up in this cycle of worry: Which government and why, and what did they access?” Fakih, the crisis and conflict director for Human Rights Watch and head of the group’s Beirut office, said in an interview. “This I thought again and again: What are they going to do with my data? And also I thought: I’ve been turned into this tool to undermine the rights of people.”

Fakih is one among dozens of human rights workers, journalists, diplomats, politicians and others who have learned that they have been victims of Pegasus infections since The Washington Post, as part of a global investigative consortium, reported on widespread abuse of the technology in July.

Takeaways from the Pegasus Project

A list published recently by Israel’s Haaretz, a partner in the Pegasus Project, tallied more than 450 known victims overall — including those named in the project and others whose cases were previously reported. And the discoveries keep coming. Research group Citizen Lab reported Tuesday that, in Poland, an opposition political leader and a co-author of a book about the head of the country’s secret services, had their phones hacked with Pegasus.

Fakih said she was unsure about why she was targeted, but she spent many months last year studying the mysterious 2020 explosion in Beirut that killed more than 200 people and caused billions of dollars in damage. That work and other efforts she oversaw for Human Rights Watch meant she routinely communicated with sensitive sources, including people who have been victimized.

She said she has contacted some close associates to warn them that her phone was infected with Pegasus — which is capable of collecting files, phone contacts, photos, audio recordings and messages on encrypted chat apps while also activating phones and cameras for real-time eavesdropping — but she could not easily reach everyone whose privacy might have been invaded.

“It’s heart-rending,” Fakih said. “My job is to talk to and about vulnerable people all day. … There was no way I could protect against this.”

She and other Human Rights Watch officials said her case underscores the rampant abuse from the largely unregulated spyware market, which includes dozens of companies worldwide. On Wednesday, Human Rights Watch called for an immediate moratorium on the sale and export of such technology until governments impose “enforceable legal frameworks requiring human rights due diligence” to prevent such abuses.

Wednesday’s report comes as the NSO Group, which makes Pegasus and licenses its use to dozens of government clients worldwide, confronts a growing number of financial, corporate and legal struggles.

The U.S. government has barred American companies from trading with it, and both Apple and Facebook’s parent company, Meta, have sued it. Israel’s attorney general last week said he was investigating news reports of Pegasus abuses by that nation’s police force. On Tuesday, the departure of the company’s chairman, Asher Levy, became public. That follows the chief executive’s November announcement, after just two weeks on the job, that he would resign.

Pegasus spyware used to hack U.S. diplomats working abroad

NSO Group said in a statement Tuesday that Levy’s departure was previously planned and that reports of financial and other troubles were unfounded. “Any attempts to present this move as a present-day resignation as a result of any publication related to NSO are completely false,” Levy said in a statement released by the company.

The Human Rights Watch report quotes the NSO Group saying it was “not aware of any active customer using [its] technology against a Human Rights Watch staff member” and would investigate the findings. The forensic investigation has been reviewed by Amnesty International’s Security Lab, an expert in tracking Pegasus.

In response to questions from reporters Tuesday, the NSO Group issued a statement that did not challenge the Human Rights Watch report. Company spokesman Oded Hershkovitz said: “NSO believes there should be an international regulatory structure put in place to ensure the responsible use of cyber intelligence tools. However, any call to suspend these lifesaving technologies until such a structure exists is naive and would only benefit the terrorists, pedophiles and hardened criminals who will evade surveillance and apprehension.”

Fakih’s two infected iPhones were on a Lebanese network and appear to have been targeted with “zero-click” attacks, meaning she didn’t need to click on a malicious link or do anything else for the hack to begin, according to the Human Rights Watch report. The report said evidence was found of five separate hacks by Pegasus on her iPhones between April and August. Some apparently used an exploit for targeting iPhones known as FORCEDENTRY. The discovery of FORCEDENTRY helped prompt Apple to sue the NSO Group in November and issue alerts to customers worldwide who may have been targeted.

A third phone used by Fakih with a U.S.-based +1 phone number did not show evidence of infection, she said, and the infected phones were not used to connect with the organization’s computer systems, minimizing the impact of the intrusion.

The list of places where Fakih oversaw investigations includes Syria, Myanmar, Israel, the Palestinian territories, Greece, Kazakhstan, Ethiopia, Lebanon, Afghanistan and the United States, Human Rights Watch said.",6.0,How does this shit get on your phone?

There was a time when the Turkish economy was truly admirable. 1Usd was 2 Tl. People had money in their pockets, they could plan European holidays, and could afford anything if they saved enough. Nowadays anything foreign costs months if not years of wages. Turkey had great economists. Özgür Demirtaş for example was a great one. Unfortunately things in Turkey don’t operate on how knowledgeable you are in your field, but how close and likeable you are to the president. You have to remember erdogan appointed his son in law as the economic minister. Where he said “if you’re looking to buy dollars and wait for the lira to crash and turn a profit, you’ll wait long” and then the lira dropped lmao and when the son in law left the seat. The lira gained value. Think about that. An empty seat gained more confidence for the economy than the presidents son in law. Did erdogan learn his lesson and appoint someone who actually knows what he’s doing ? No he doubled down and said “I know economics” ( forged diploma btw ) and  here we are.

So what happened ? What’s the current situation in Turkey ? 

Well people started to protest marching “ political party resign” and demanded an early election. However supreme leader president said “no we aren’t a tribal nation that has elections every 20 months”. Which is ironic since he called the last snap election. Anyways in the coming days expect waves of people getting labelled terrorist by the regime for speaking up against the president. 

The cops were expected to beat the shit out of the protestors, although marching and protesting is considered a right in Turkey. Luckily in some provinces police stated that they have no intention of locking people up for peacefully protesting. 

We have yet to see how this will play out. If you know Turkish people, or stumble upon any online. Please acknowledge that you’re probably talking to someone who isn’t a fan of erdogan. Be supportive of them.

> The EU competition watchdog had taken issue with two kinds of deals made with phone makers, one being payments for only pre-installing Google Search on their devices known as revenue sharing arrangements because these shut out rivals.

2021-09-22,EU plans to legislate for common phone charger despite Apple grumbles,23751,[deleted],4453.0,"There is much more behind it.

- One thing is the universal USB-C requirement. They asked for years that the industry has to find one harmonised solution, whichever they want. They failed, mainly because Apple played some games with the legal definition what a ""cable"" is.

- EU want starting from 2023 function updates mandatory for 5 years (tablets 6years) to be delivered within 3 months or earlier if annother phone gets the update first.

- Batteries must be having 80% capacity after 500 cycles. Tables have something with 1000cyles because they live longer on average. So far only apples batteries keep up the first point, which will start a race. The battery must be exchangeable within some defined technical and cost parameters.

- Repair parts must be accessible by all professional repair stores. This includes batteries, screens, microfones, cameras, connectors and some more. Also the price must be communicated at the release of the phone and is not allowed to increase afterwards.

- Screens must further be accessible also for retail buyers.

- Repair manuals must be available non-discrimatory to buy at a reasonable price.

- The phone must withstand 100 drops from 1m without damage.

- The label must state the dirt and waterproofness certification (minimum is IPx4 so save water droplets as it often ""kills"" the warranty), the electric efficiency (which saves indirectly battery life), the battery life if above the minimum requirements, the average battery time, drop survival classification and some more details.

Companies request some more years of ""laisse faire"" politics to let it run without changing the system...

...however the European commission has used the recommendations from the Frauenhofer Institute (the guys from the MP3 audio standard) and went even further with some implementation details.

Navalny and allies who hoped to subvert the commanding position of President Vladimir V. Putin&#039;s governing party.

> &quot;Both platforms have been notified and in accordance with the law they made these decisions, as it seems,&#039;&#039; he said.Apple did not respond to requests for comment about the availability of the Navalny app in its store.The app disappeared just as voting got underway in the three-day parliamentary election, in which Mr. Navalny&#039;s team was hoping to use its app - called&quot;Navalny&quot; - to consolidate the opposition vote in each of Russia&#039;s 225 electoral districts.

> &quot;Removing the Navalny app from stores is a shameful act of political censorship,&quot; an aide to Mr. Navalny, Ivan Zhdanov, said on Twitter.

> A single bitcoin transaction generates the same amount of electronic waste as throwing two iPhones in the bin, according to a new analysis by economists from the Dutch central bank and MIT.While the carbon footprint of bitcoin is well studied, less attention has been paid to the vast churn in computer hardware that the cryptocurrency incentivises.

> Specialised computer chips called ASICs are sold with no other purpose than to run the algorithms that secure the bitcoin network, a process called mining that rewards those who partake with bitcoin payouts.

> The reason why e-waste is such a problem for the cryptocurrency is that, unlike most computing hardware, ASICs have no alternative use beyond bitcoin mining, and if they cannot be used to mine bitcoin profitably, they have no future purpose at all.

> SEOUL, Aug 24 - South Korea is likely to bar Google and Apple from requiring software developers to use their payment systems, effectively stopping them from charging commissions on in-app purchases, the first such curbs on the tech giants by a major economy.

> &quot;For gaming apps, Google has been forcing app developers to use its own payment system ... and it wants to expand its policy to other apps like music or webtoon,&quot; said Kwon Se-hwa, a general manager at the Korea Internet Corporations Association, a nonprofit group representing Korean IT firms.

> Earlier this month in the United States, a bipartisan trio of senators introduced a bill that would rein in app stores of companies that they said exert too much market control, including Apple and Google.

The new passage reads as follows:

“The Audit Committee and Board regularly review and discuss with management Apple’s antitrust risks. Apple’s Antitrust Compliance Officer is responsible for the development, review, and execution of Apple’s Antitrust Compliance Program and regularly reports to the Audit Committee. These reports cover, among other matters, the alignment of the program with Apple’s potential antitrust risks, and the effectiveness of the program’s design in detecting and preventing antitrust issues and promoting compliance with laws and Apple policies.””",3.0,"Good.

* repair shops have to agree to unannounced audits and inspections by Apple to determine if they're using ""prohibited"" repair components, which can result in fines.
 * this makes sense since you can sign an agreement but try to do something fishy. Bit invasive but not unreasonable.
* Even if a shop leaves the program, Apple can continue to inspect it for up to five years.
 * this is shitty - if you leave, the partnership is concluded
* Repair shops are required to share information about their customers with Apple, including names, phone numbers, and home addresses.
 * sorry what? That's pretty terrible. If I come to a repair shop, I don't want that shop to give my info to any other company.
* Customers who receive service from an independent repair shop have to sign an acknowledgement that they understand they're not receiving repairs from an Apple Authorized shop and that Apple won't warranty the repair, which as right to repair advocate Nathan Proctor told Motherboard, is essentially requiring them to advertise against themselves.
 * I think customers either understand this or should understand this already.
* Shops that partner with Apple for supplies must avoid all ""prohibited products,"" which includes both counterfeit parts and ""products or service parts that infringe on Apple's intellectual property,"" which legal experts believe is ambiguous wording.
 * yes, this has to be defined better. It sounds reasonable at first blush but who knows.
* Apple is also able to seize any prohibited products, which is a potential problem because many repair shops also repair non-Apple devices.
 * Nope, Apple can call whoever in the law enforcement takes care of this kind of stuff. Apple isn't the police.
* Repair businesses that violate Apple's rules can be forced to pay Apple $1,000 for every transaction during an audit period if more than two percent of business transactions involve ""prohibited products.""
 * the fines are just unreasonably high. Also - and I missed this when I wrote the original comment - if they can fine a business based on ""two percent of business transactions"", this implies that Apple would be requiring these shops to give them all financial data for Apple to audit in order to make this determination.

Apps on iOS are sandboxed so you can't access data about other app's launch and usage. These apps were using MDM profiles to get that usage data. This also meant that the user's internet data was going through these third parties which is a pretty big privacy issue. Plus having MDM profiles gave these third parties enormous access to the user's device settings. Using MDM profiles are only intended to be used for controlling employee and VPN access for filtering apps for company phones. They are not to be used for this direct to consumer purpose. Same reason why Facebook's certificates was blocked because they were abusing the MDM profile for different purposes. This was clearly against Apple's policies and against the terms of developer agreement. This would basically allow all your children's phone data as well as device settings to be accessible to these 3rd parties. That's bad, exploitative of underage kids or controlling parents/spouse, against the TOS as well as using MDM profiles for wrong intentions.

This article claiming it's because Apple is trying to eliminate competition forgot to mention any of the above very important facts. Also the developer claiming 30 day warning period Apple gave them without enough details is plain dumb. Any reasonable developer who has read the App store guidelines would understand what they were doing was against the TOS.

Your phone doesn't just throw out a photo for every other phone to pick up. Even if you have Airdrop set to everyone, it doesn't work like that. Having it set to everyone just means your name will show up as an option when someone is sending something. The girl either accidentally hit the wrong name or was intentionally sending the photo to random people who kept their Airdrop set to everyone. Since multiple people got it, I'd guess it was intentional because she'd have to click on all their names.

I've seen people who like to randomly Airdrop photos to people who have their Airdrop set to everyone to watch their reaction. That's probably what happened here but it didn't go as she planned.",77.0,"The fake crime scene photo wasn't exactly ""grisly"". Shitty headline.

“It was found that the girl was just trying to airdrop the photo to her mom, Kelly said, but because she airdropped using bluetooth, people in range of her phone had the option of accepting and viewing the photo.”

What the fuck does that mean?  AirDrop is a specific Apple technology that uses Bluetooth automatically to locate nearby recipients and creates an ad how WiFi network to transfer.  You don’t “chose” to use Bluetooth with airdrop it’s inherent and invisible to the whole process.  Also the Mercury article says she accidentally sent it to a whole bunch of people. How???  Airdrop receiving has three settings, receiving off, contacts only, and everyone.  I’m trying to find evidence to back this up but I thought the default was contacts only, meaning someone has to be in your contacts address book with a valid iCloud I’d before you’ll show up in someone else’s airdrop list.  So all those people had to be set to “everyone” to get this picture.  There is also not a “send to everyone” option in airdrop.  So she would have had to hit the wrong person one at a time, several times, and all those people would have had to have changed a default setting in their iPhones sometime in the past to expose themselves to this risk.

Based on the descriptions in these articles, I would say that the girl is lying, because this sounds like a classic tactic of a bored teenager messing with a bunch of “olds” who don’t understand their own technology.  However, the technical facts of the articles are so poorly written I’m going to say the originator of the article was too lazy or stupid to get the facts right, and the rest of the world simply copied off them, since that’s what most of the press does.  Then all these bad facts lead to a bad conclusion by everyone else so the conclusion that she is lying could not be supported adequately.

> Grayshift has been shopping its iPhone cracking technology to police forces. The firm, which includes an ex-Apple security engineer on its staff, provided demonstrations to potential customers, according to one email.


> The GrayKey itself is a small, 4x4 inches box with two lightning cables for connecting iPhones, according to photographs published by cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes. The device comes in two versions: a $15,000 one which requires online connectivity and allows 300 unlocks (or $50 per phone), and and an offline, $30,000 version which can crack as many iPhones as the customer wants. Marketing material seen by Forbes says GrayKey can unlock devices running iterations of Apple’s latest mobile operating system iOS 11, including on the iPhone X, Apple’s most recent phone.


> The issue GrayKey overcomes is that iPhones encrypt user data by default. Those in physical possession normally cannot access the phone’s data, such as contact list, saved messages, or photos, without first unlocking the phone with a passcode or fingerprint. Malwarebytes’ post says **GrayKey can unlock an iPhone in around two hours, or three days or longer for 6 digit passcodes**.


> To be clear, the FBI already makes heavy use of technology similar to GrayKey, and spends millions of dollars on equipment that cracks phones without using mandated backdoors. Motherboard previously found that the FBI bought over $2 million worth of forensics tools from established vendor Cellebrite. Back in 2016, the Bureau’s General Counsel said the FBI could unlock most phones it seized.


> In March, the New York Times reported that FBI and Justice Department officials have reignited the hunt for backdoors, and have been quietly meeting with security researchers. And earlier this month, Cyberscoop reported that staffers of the Senate Judiciary Committee have been contacting US tech companies regarding potential future legislation around encryption.


> But to be clear, GrayKey is not the end of this debate. Whatever exploits GrayKey is taking advantage of may stop working at some point. The FBI wanted to force Apple to tweak the San Bernardino iPhone running in February 2016; Cellebrite announced it could crack devices running iOS 9—the particular iOS version the phone was using—in July 2016. Even when phone crackers eventually catch up, there can still be a period of time when agencies may indeed be dark on a suspect’s phone.


> “The FBI does not comment on specific tools or technologies; however, there is no one size fits all solution to Going Dark,” an FBI spokesperson told Motherboard in a statement.


> In March, FBI Director Wray said the Bureau had nearly 7,800 phones it could not unlock last year. Maybe the FBI could get in touch with the country’s local police forces.

Of course, it wasn't me, but they didn't know that. Turns out my front license plate had been stolen and someone put it on another Honda and successfully eluded them, so they came to the address the plate led to. We offered them some lemonade and sent our daughter to her room while they waited for another officer who'd seen the guy to come and say it wasn't me. The tension was pretty palpable - they didn't want to sit down, didn't want lemonade, really looked like they just wanted to beat someone down the whole time.

2016-08-26,IPhone Users Urged to Update Software After Security Flaws Are Found,5,"Full text: ""SAN FRANCISCO — One of the world’s most evasive digital arms dealers is believed to have been taking advantage of three security vulnerabilities in popular Apple products in its efforts to spy on dissidents and journalists.
Investigators discovered that a company called the NSO Group, an Israeli outfit that sells software that invisibly tracks a target’s mobile phone, was responsible for the intrusions. The NSO Group’s software can read text messages and emails and track calls and contacts. It can even record sounds, collect passwords and trace the whereabouts of the phone user.
In response, Apple on Thursday released a patched version of its mobile software, iOS 9.3.5. Users can get the patch through a normal software update.
Apple fixed the holes 10 days after a tip from two researchers, Bill Marczak and John Scott Railton, at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs, and Lookout, a San Francisco mobile security company.
“We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits,” said Fred Sainz, a company spokesman.
In interviews and manuals, the NSO Group’s executives have long boasted that their spyware worked like a “ghost,” tracking the moves and keystrokes of its targets, without leaving a trace. But until this month, it was not clear how exactly the group was monitoring its targets, or who exactly it was monitoring.
A clearer picture began to emerge on Aug. 10, when Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, who has been tracked by surveillance software several times, began receiving suspicious text messages. The messages purported to contain information about the torture of U.A.E. citizens.
Mr. Mansoor passed the messages to researchers at the Citizen Lab, who confirmed they were an attempt to track him through his iPhone.
This latest effort was far more sophisticated than what was found aimed at his devices before. The researchers found it was connecting to 200 servers, several of them registered to the NSO Group. Strewn throughout the spyware code were references to Pegasus, the name of an NSO Group spyware product.
Citizen Lab brought in Lookout to help examine the code. Together, they discovered that the spyware relied on three previously unknown iOS vulnerabilities — called “zero days” because Apple didn’t know about them and had zero days to patch them.
In many cases, the NSO Group had designed its tools to impersonate those of the Red Cross, Facebook, Federal Express, CNN, Al Jazeera, Google and even the Pokemon Company to gain the trust of its targets, according to the researchers. 
Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, has been tracked by surveillance software several times. 
“NSO Group was very professional, and very effective in staying silent,” said Mike Murray, a vice president at Lookout.
In recent years, zero day flaws have been traded among hackers, brokers, companies like the NSO Group, and spy agencies and law enforcement networks eager for ways to break into devices.
Flaws in Apple’s iOS software are sold at a premium. Last year, a similar zero-day exploit in Apple’s iOS software was sold to Zerodium, a Washington buyer and seller of zero-days, for $1 million.
Earlier this year, James Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, announced that his agency had paid hackers who found a way for the F.B.I. to crack into an iPhone used by one of the shooters in last year’s mass killings in San Bernardino, Calif. Neither the hackers nor the F.B.I. have told Apple how this was accomplished.
Apple’s software update patches the NSO Group’s exploits, but it is unclear whether the company has patched the vulnerabilities used by the F.B.I. to crack into its iPhone. Apple recently began a “bug bounty” program to pay hackers who report vulnerabilities in its systems.
Among the other NSO targets, besides Mr. Mansoor, were Rafael Cabrera, a Mexican journalist, who broke a story on conflicts of interest among Mexico’s ruling family. In several cases, NSO Group’s tools had been crafted to target users in Yemen, Turkey, Mozambique, Mexico, Kenya and the U.A.E.
Zamir Dahbash, an NSO Group spokesman, said in an email, “The company sells only to authorized governmental agencies, and fully complies with strict export control laws and regulations.”
Mr. Dahbash added that NSO Group does not operate any of its systems and requires that its customers use its products in a “lawful manner.” “Specifically,” he said, “the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes.”
He would not say if the software is used by government agencies in the U.A.E. or Mexico.
In 2014, NSO Group sold a majority stake to San Francisco-based private equity firm Francisco Partners Management LLC for $120 million. Francisco Partners declined to comment.
Mr. Mansoor said in an interview that the discoveries were a sad reminder that no matter what he does to protect his devices and digital security, he will continue to be a target for companies that provide this sort of spying technology.
“I guess I am their regular customer,” he said. “I am the guinea pig.”
Bill Marczak, the researcher at Citizen Lab who has been helping Mr. Mansoor protect his digital security, said that the surveillance experienced by Mr. Mansoor is likely to expand.
“The targeting of these activists and dissidents is a taste of what’s to come,” Mr. Marczak said. “What they’re facing today will be faced by ordinary users tomorrow.”

*Edit 3:* Source links. The original post had no sources and was derived mostly from memory and looking up simple facts related to Apple.

Part 1 of 2:

This thread is pretty depressing to read, unfortunately. There is a [decent amount of misinformation]( http://www.taxjustice.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ten_Reasons_Full_Report.pdf), and most of it is in favor of the very large corporation instead of every other tax payer. So let me try to clear up a few things, and you can hopefully judge the situation a bit more accurately.

First and foremost, the money Apple (and other corporations) are holding ""overseas"" isn't actually in some far off distant land like Ireland or the Cayman Islands. [It is here, in US banks, being used by lenders to underwrite loans and make profits on, and generally invested in US assets.](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/tax-reform/report/2014/01/09/81681/offshore-corporate-profits-the-only-thing-trapped-is-tax-revenue/) Apple even takes out its [own loans (called bonds)](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-02/apple-said-to-plan-5-billion-bond-offering-in-fourth-since-2013) against [this money](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/04/30/with-all-of-apples-cash-why-is-it-issuing-bonds/) (at [under inflation rates](http://www.thestreet.com/story/13053211/1/how-us-corporations-use-overseas-cash-in-us-without-paying-taxes.html)) and uses it to pay for a variety of things, [often times dividends and share buybacks.](http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/10/27/apple-inc-snatches-up-14-billion-of-its-own-shares-in-massive-q4-buyback-surge) In effect, this money is already being used [throughout the economy](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/26/apple-investment-manager-braeburn-capital), and the only difference between it now and when it is officially ""repatriated"" is that the money is listed under [a different column in Apple's ledgers.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-22/tim-cook-s-181-billion-headache-apple-s-cash-held-overseas)

Secondly, the law of the US is that all foreign profits made by US companies are taxed at a federal income tax rate, and that for Apple this rate would come to [about 40%](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/051915/corporate-tax-rates-highs-and-lows.asp?header_alt=a), minus any [taxes paid in other countries](http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/10/apple-google-microsoft-hold-more-than-336b-overseas-via-legal-tax-loopholes/) (a [foreign tax deduction](https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/What-Foreign-Taxes-Qualify-For-The-Foreign-Tax-Credit%3F)). But, the trick is, this tax is allowed to be [deferred if the profits originate from a foreign subsidiary of the company](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/general/news/2011/03/16/9215/tax-expenditure-of-the-week-offshore-tax-deferral/). Companies such as Apple have devised and been advised by highly skilled tax accountants how to make large portions of their profits [appear as though they were generated overseas](http://www.taxjustice.net/topics/corporate-tax/transfer-pricing/) so as to claim they are really being made by those foreign subsidiaries, even if [this may not be true](http://www.americansfortaxfairness.org/badapple/). Much of Apple's R&D, design, management, marketing, warehouses, and employees are all from/in the US, yet only 30% of its profits are attributed to US sales by its own measures. Does the sale of an Apple product account for 100% of its profit? Or does each step (R&D, design, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, etc.) account for the total profit? If Apple were multiple companies doing all of these aspects independently, you better believe each one would charge a price that represented far more than what Apple is reporting they are worth.

Third, it really shouldn't matter what other countries are doing or what should be done in a perfect, business friendly tax environment. [The law in the US is that all companies pay taxes on their foreign income](https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Abusive-Offshore-Tax-Avoidance-Schemes-Talking-Points), irrelevant if [they think it is fair that they should or not](http://www.americansfortaxfairness.org/tax-fairness-briefing-booklet/fact-sheet-corporate-tax-rates/). Apple knew this when they started their company, and still know this today. Apple shareholders also know this (at least, they should), and even Apple tax accountants. In fact, no tax accountant probably will tell you that what Apple is doing is actually legal, but will say that [there is some risk](http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2013/oct/20137721.html) that what they are doing is illegal and that the only way to really find out would be to have it [challenged in court](http://taxblawg.net/2013/10/09/apples-double-irish-with-a-dutch-sandwich-goes-down-easy-with-sec/). Bringing such a challenge to court is difficult, as it requires intimate knowledge of Apple's books, [which they don't just hand out to anyone.](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/05/30/how-multinationals-can-best-be-taxed/corporate-transparency-is-an-essential-first-step-for-tax-fairness) So, Apple and other companies bite the risk and move their money overseas to tax havens like Ireland on the reasonable belief that this won't happen. But in doing so, they are without a shred of doubt avoiding the point of the tax law, [subverting tax policy](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/293/465.html) in the name of shareholder value.

Which brings me to point four, which is that shareholder value is a [pretty lame reason](https://hbr.org/2010/04/the-myth-of-shareholder-capitalism) to avoid paying taxes. For starters, as stated previously, shareholders know what the corporate tax rate is when they buy a US stock, and they know all the rules that apply because of it. Sure, they can want a company like Apple to avoid paying taxes as much as possible, so that more of the profits go to them (remember, taxes only occur on PROFITS, not revenues). But that is sort of like rooting for a football team to break the rules to win a game. It counts as a victory, but [everyone knows you cheated](http://www.gallup.com/poll/153947/Americans-Split-Whether-Taxes-Rise.aspx), and [it doesn't really mean you were better than your opponent](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-arensmeyer/unfair-tax-policies-still_b_5997568.html). Second off, why are shareholders considered the only stakeholders in this business? [Shouldn't employees, vendors and suppliers, and the supporting communities also have a stake in these profits?](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/15/tax-corporations-treasury-large-companies) All contribute to the end result, so shouldn't they all get a say in how the money is distributed? And if you think that Apple doesn't owe the US community anything, you're fooling yourself. Nearly all of its workers were [educated in the US](http://www.forbes.com/sites/connieguglielmo/2012/03/02/apple-touts-itself-as-big-job-creator-in-the-u-s/), it uses [US infrastructure like roads and the internet to distribute its products](http://www.seiu-usww.org/2014/04/15/security-officers-community-supporters-urge-apple-to-pay-taxes-for-bay-area-upkeep/), it uses the [US military for international protection when its goods are shipped over seas](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-importance-of-us-military-might-shouldnt-be-underestimated/2012/02/02/gIQAX5pVlQ_story.html), it relies on [US patent law](http://www.pcworld.com/article/258387/apple_patent_wins_samsung_tablet_blocked_from_us_and_apple_awarded_27_new_patents.html), [contract law](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/06/06/despite-tax-rules-companies-stick-with-u-s/), and [US court systems to settle disputes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._litigation), and relies on US consumers to use it products. It is kind of fitting that when Tim Cook was pulled before Congress back in 2013, he threatened that Apple would leave to not pay its US taxes, and the Senator leading the charge against him said that [if Apple left, it wouldn't be Apple](http://www.macrumors.com/2013/05/21/excerpts-of-apple-executives-senate-committee-testimony-on-tax-policy/), effectively calling his bluff. Finally, it should be mentioned that [Apple management are also shareholders](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-much-apples-top-execs-made-last-year-2015-1) and get compensated with [very generous stock packages.](http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/23/technology/tim-cook-pay/) Thus, the management, in wanting to not pay taxes for shareholders, is effectively asking to not pay taxes for themselves, a clear conflict of interest.",1674.0,"This is still very unpatriotic. Apple would not exist today, if it weren't for the infrastructure and markets that the US provided, and they turned their back on it. Regardless of the effect this would have on Apple if they brought their money home, they shouldn't have done it in the first place, and with Apple's profit margins as high as they are, I find it difficult for them to state that our tax system is only efficient with an industrial model in mind.",332.0,"As a Canadian, does apple profit that's earned in Canada and is taxed by Canadians get included in this $75 billion number?

You can listen to this all you want, but I prefer to believe that this is a move to get people to sell and bring the stock price down so that more people (particularly those captured by these comments who will not only want to buy, but want to commit - win-win) will buy it. In other words, it's a very creative marketing strategy. They're making us think they care. In reality, it's a play-up to earn respect and get the loss back through commitment and brand image.

Apple has demonstrated time and time again that it's really only ever about the money and that environmental sustainability is not nearly as important.

In July 2012, Apple abandoned an important environmental standard (EPEAT) - and this happened under Tim Cook's leadership. There's a reason they rejoined a few days later: they realized that they would lose money over this due to their customers' concerns. Realizing this, Cook began to invest in sustainability oriented infrastructure to do precisely what you said: improve brand image.

Do not believe this man. Do not buy Apple stock if/when the price goes down. 

It's the year 2014. 97% of all scientists agree that climate change is a real issue. He's trying to make you think he's special for this opinion, but there shoudn't be anything special about being pro-environment anymore - I believe it should be a basic decency in all of us.",6.0,What independent-thinking person would buy Apple stock in the first place?,5.0,"Misleading article?
